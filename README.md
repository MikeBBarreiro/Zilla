Zilla
=====

###Description

```
This is a small game still in progress that I decided to work on, 
using javascript and phaser.js to create, ___Zilla___. You start off on a platform right 
off the atmosphere of earth right in front of the great, ___King Ghidorah___. You have 
to blast your way and doge through Ghidorah's projectiles and make it to the 
end of the level facing King Ghidorah's clones. Good luck, I cant even beat my 
own game. Very challenging and addictive.
